**Ticket Comments:**

* This phishing attempt involved an email with an attached file (filename="bfsvc.exe") claiming to be a resume and cover letter. The attachment hash (54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b) was confirmed to be malicious through a threat intelligence tool.
* Due to the presence of a confirmed malicious attachment, this phishing attempt is a medium severity incident and requires escalation to a level-two SOC analyst for further investigation and potential user containment actions.

**Additional Notes:**
