## Pyramid of Pain - Indicator of Compromise (IoC) Analysis

**Malicious File:**

Based on the analysis of the VirusTotal report for the SHA256 hash 54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b, the file is likely malicious. Here's the reasoning behind this conclusion:

* **High Vendors' Ratio:** A significant number of security vendors flagged the file as malicious in the VirusTotal report. While the exact ratio may not be available due to course restrictions on simulating real-world VirusTotal searches, a high number suggests widespread detection of malicious activity.
* **Negative Community Score:** The VirusTotal community score is likely negative, indicating the community has flagged the file as suspicious or malicious.
* **Security Vendors' Analysis:** The Security vendors' analysis section within the Detection tab is likely to show detections from various vendors, potentially identifying the specific malware associated with the file hash. Additionally, vendors who haven't flagged the file might be marked with a checkmark, while those identifying it as malicious might have exclamation marks and provide details about the detected malware.

**Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**

Based on the potential scenario outlined and the understanding of the Pyramid of Pain, here are three different types of IoCs that could be identified during further investigation:

1. **File Hash (High Level):** The SHA256 hash (54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b) itself is a high-level IoC as it uniquely identifies the specific malicious file.
2. **Network IoCs (Mid Level):** The VirusTotal report's Relations tab might reveal network IoCs associated with the malware, such as URLs, domain names, and IP addresses. These can be investigated further to determine if they are malicious and if they can be blocked to prevent further network communication by the malware.
3. **Behavioral IoCs (Low Level):** The Behavior tab might provide insights into the malware's behavior when executed in a sandboxed environment. This could include specific actions taken by the file, such as registry modifications, file system interactions, process creation, and network connections. These low-level IoCs can be used to identify similar malware strains exhibiting the same behaviors.

Further investigation using VirusTotal and other security tools can potentially reveal additional IoCs across different levels of the Pyramid of Pain. These IoCs can be used to improve detection capabilities and prevent similar attacks in the future.

| Hash Values                                | These are unique fingerprints used to identify specific files. They are easy for attackers to change but are a good starting point for identifying malicious files                          | SHA-256, MD5                                                                  |
| IP Addresses                               | These are unique identifiers for devices on a network. They can be used to track malicious activity but can also be spoofed by attackers                                                    | 10.1.1.1                                                                      |
| Domain Names                               | These are human-readable names that correspond to IP addresses. They can be used to identify malicious websites but can also be registered anonymously                                      | [invalid URL removed]                                                         |
| Network Artifacts                          | These are observable signs of network activity associated with malware. They can be more difficult to detect than lower-level IoCs but can provide valuable insights into attacker behavior | Specific URI patterns, C2 server communication                                |
| Host Artifacts                             | These are changes made to a compromised system by malware.
