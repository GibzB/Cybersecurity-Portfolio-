## Security Incident Report

**Section 1: Identify the network protocol involved in the incident**

The primary network protocol identified in the packet captures during the investigation is  **DNS (Domain Name System)** . We can see this protocol being used in several parts of the tcpdump log:

* Lines 14:18:32.192571 and 14:18:32.204388 show the user's machine querying the DNS server (dns.google.domain) to resolve the hostname "yummyrecipesforme.com" into an IP address (203.0.113.22).
* Lines 14:20:32.192571 and 14:20:32.204388 show another DNS request, this time resolving the hostname "greatrecipesforme.com" to a different IP address (192.0.2.172).

These DNS requests are crucial for the user's machine to locate the web server hosting the requested websites.

**Section 2: Document the Incident**

**Incident Summary:**

A disgruntled former employee gained unauthorized access to the administrative panel of yummyrecipesforme.com, a website selling recipes and cookbooks. The attacker exploited a weak password to breach the system and injected malicious code into the website. This code prompted users visiting the website to download a file. Downloading the file redirected users to a spoofed website (greatrecipesforme.com) containing malware.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. The former employee used a brute-force attack to guess the password for the administrative account of yummyrecipesforme.com.
2. After gaining access, the attacker injected malicious code into the website.
3. When users visited the website, the code prompted them to download a file.
4. Downloading the file redirected users to a fake website containing malware.
5. Several customers contacted the company's helpdesk reporting the issue.
6. The website owner was unable to log in to the admin panel and contacted the website hosting provider.
7. Cybersecurity analysts investigated the incident and confirmed the website compromise.
8. Analysis of the downloaded file revealed a script that redirected users from the legitimate website to the spoofed one.

**Impact:**

* **Website compromise:** The attacker altered the website's functionality to distribute malware.
* **Potential data loss:** Downloaded malware could steal user information.
* **Loss of customer trust:** The incident may damage the company's reputation and customer trust.

**Section 3: Recommend one remediation for brute force attacks**

One crucial security measure to prevent brute-force attacks is to  **enforce strong passwords and implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)** .

* **Strong Passwords:** Enforce complex passwords that are at least 12 characters long and include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Discourage the use of dictionary words, personal information, and easily guessable phrases. Additionally, consider password rotation policies requiring users to change their passwords periodically.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification factor beyond the password during login attempts. This could be a code sent to the user's phone or a fingerprint scan. Even if an attacker guesses the password correctly, they wouldn't be able to access the account without the additional verification code.

Implementing both strong passwords and MFA significantly increases the difficulty of brute-force attacks. Attackers would need to not only guess the password but also gain access to the user's additional verification factor to successfully compromise an account.
