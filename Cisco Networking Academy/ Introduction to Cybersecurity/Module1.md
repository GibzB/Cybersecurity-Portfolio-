# Q1. Every organization is at risk of a cyber attack and therefore must take appropriate action to protect itself. Thinking back to each of the two security breach examples outlined above, what measures could these organizations have implemented in order to have prevented these security breaches?

In both cases, the organizations need to invest in improved security practices.

This might include:

* investing in cybersecurity training for all staff so that they are aware of and able to spot a cyber attack
* enforcing two factor authentication for employees accessing files and applications that contain sensitive data
* maintaining log files and ongoing monitoring to identify anomalous behavior that might indicate a data breach
* storing the passwords of customers using a combination of salting and robust hashing algorithms
* separating cloud-based resources from the public Internet into an isolated private network segment
* granting employee access to personal data and internal systems only via a secure VPN connection.

# Q2. What Do Hackers Want? So, with all this information about you available online, what do hackers want? Of course, they want your money. Can you think of an example that you have experienced yourself or that you have heard or read about, where cybercriminals have accessed or tried to access financial information online?

A cybercriminal can take advantage of your relationships, accessing your online accounts and appealing to your good nature to try and trick you into wiring money to your friends or family in a time of need. For example, there have been many reported cases of hackers impersonating family members and sending messages stating that they need money wired in order to get home from abroad after losing their wallets.

And while you may think that your frequent flyer air miles are not valuable to cybercriminals, think again. In 2015, cybercriminals hacked approximately 10,000 American Airlines and United accounts, booking free flights and upgrades using stolen credentials. Even though the frequent flyer miles were returned to the customers by the airlines, this example demonstrates the value of your login credentials.
